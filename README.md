# Cell-membrane-based-cell-segmentation
Genetic-labelling cell membranes to define cell boundaries in sequencing-based spatial transcriptomes. The current sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics technologies typically use nuclear regions to represent a cell, but this strategy excludes the cytoplasmic regions of the cell. Furthermore, in some specific cell types, such as intestinal epithelial cells and multinucleated cells in the liver, the definition of a cell is not accurate. Therefore, using the cell membrane to define the boundaries of single cells in spatial transcriptomics is more consistent with biological definitions.

# Tool for cell segmentation
- Cellpose: This software is used for cell segmentation and can perform human-in-the-loop specificity training based on the features of your spatial transcriptomics images, enabling more accurate segmentation of cells with special morphologies.
